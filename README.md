-x : the duration of the game in number of turns

-j : option to output the data.

We don't kill players anymore. (Timeout)

Be careful, there is a time dependency in pipe_socket_translator

Be careful the hlt object are not the same when debugging than when playing. The objects can be used with similar functions though, for convenience.

Infinite games can be run with as many bots as desired.
