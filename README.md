## Artificial Intelligence & Reinforcement Learning

### Teaser

Halite is an open source artificial intelligence programming challenge, created by <a href="https://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a>, where players build bots using the coding language of their choice to battle on a two-dimensional virtual board. The last bot standing or the bot with all the territory wins. Victory will require micromanaging of the movement of pieces, optimizing a botâ€™s combat ability, and braving a branching factor billions of times higher than that of Go.

### Rules

Each player starts with a single square, and is given information about the surrounding squares to conquer. Each of these squares have a given strength - pink number in the image below, and also represented by the size of the square.

The origin square itself has a strength.

To conquer a adjacent square, the player must have sufficient strength. The remaining strength is afterwards reduced.

Each square **possessed by a player** can gain strength at each turn according to a production map

But beware, only a square that doesn't attack an adjacent square increases its strength.

To conquer the map **as fast as possible**, we need to attack the squares with a **high production rate** and a **weak strength**.

### Reinforcement Learning strategy
 
We will try to teach our Bot to expand quickly using **rewards associated with the production rate of the squares**.
